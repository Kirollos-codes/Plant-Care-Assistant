# Plant Care Assistant ðŸŒ±

## Description
The **Plant Care Assistant** is a Java-based console application that helps users manage their plant collection by tracking care routines. It allows users to **add, remove, list, and find plants**, providing essential care instructions for each plant type. This project was created as part of my **CS501** class.

## Features
- **Add plants** to your virtual garden (Succulents & Flowering Plants).
- **Remove plants** from the garden.
- **List all plants** with their details.
- **Find a specific plant** and get care instructions.
- **Interactive menu** for easy plant management.

## How It Works
1. **Choose an option** from the menu:
   - Add a new plant by specifying its **name, type, and watering frequency**.
   - Remove a plant by entering its **name**.
   - View all plants in your garden.
   - Search for a specific plant and get care tips.
   - Exit the application.
2. The program **stores plant data** in a simple `ArrayList`.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Abstract Classes & Inheritance**
- **User Input Handling**
